## Research
My research interests lie in Complex Analysis and Integrable systems. 

I use results from classical Nevanlinna theory to find meromorphic solutions of system of differential equations that are in general not integrable. In this direction, I have concluded all meromorphic solutions of a 3 dimensional Lotka-Volterra system. I also use the method to charactize the meromorphic solutions of a spinning top system (Euler-Poisson equations).

In discrete equations, I investigate the Riemann surface of the inverse of the Koenig functions (also known as the Poincar√® functions), which can be used to expressed particular solutions of some (non-integrable) difference equations. In addidtion, I study special solutions of some functional differential equations.

I also look at counterexamples of Nevanlinna theory on the upper half-plane with respect to the classical theory.
