My research interests lie in Complex analysis, Integrable systems, and Special functions. 

## Complex Differential Equation, Nevanlinna theory, Non-integrable equations

My main PhD research overlaps the topics in Nevanlinna theory (Complex analysis) and integrable differential equations (Integrable systems). The motivation mainly stems from most ODEs cannot be solved explicitly. The solvability and integrability (vaguely means that the general solutions can be expressed in some canonical forms) only appear for specific equations, in the case of ODEs, are those with the Painlevè property. Then given non-integrable ODEs, the general solutions are difficult to derive, so we hope to find special solutions. Regarding this special class of solutions, there has been series of work done in the class of meromorphic functions. This is due to many results in complex function theory allow us to understand meromorphic functions to some degree. One common tool is Nevanlinna theory (value distribution theory). With Nevanlinna theory, we can find all meromorphic solutions of certain ODEs; Of course, we cannot apply to all non-integrable equations. One additional assumption is the fact that there are only finitely many Laurent series. This is often called the Eremenko finiteness property. Eremenko proves that any unique top degree autonomous polynomial differential equation with the finiteness property admits all meromorphic solutions in Class W (elliptic functions and their degenerated cases). Halburd and Wang notice that as long as the Laurent series admit finitely many known first few terms (later coefficients are allowed to be free), it is still possible to do some analysis on ODE (in their case, the Hayman equation) to find all meromorphic solutions. My work is to use this extended notion to work with system of ODEs such as the 3D Lotka-Volterra system and the Euler-Poisson equations. One of the main apsect in this extension is to find a small function in Nevanlinna sense imitating the roles of constant of quadratures. What amazing about the ODEs I am working on is that those satisfy the Nevanlinna slow-growth property, which allows us to conclude that the small function is constant in a sense that given a meromorphic function, this small function must be a constant. With this small function, we can find all meromorphic solutions. Further detail regarding this theme can be found in our work on the Lotka-Volterra system.
