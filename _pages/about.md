I am currently a [PhD student](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/86353-techheang-meng/about) in Mathematics under a Teaching Assistant Fellowship at University College London (UCL), under the supervision of [Professor Rod Halburd](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahrha/).

About my research
======
My research interests lie in Complex Analysis and Integrable systems. 

I use results from classical Nevanlinna theory to find meromorphic solutions of system of differential equations that are in general not integrable. In this direction, I have concluded all meromorphic solutions of a 3 dimensional Lotka-Volterra system. I also use the method to charactize the meromorphic solutions of a spinning top system (Euler-Poisson equations).

I also investigate the Riemann surface of the inverse of the Koenig functions (also known as the Poincar√® functions), which can be used to expressed particular solutions of some (non-integrable) discrete equations.
