I am currently a PhD student in Mathematics at University College London (UCL), under the supervision of Professor Rod Halburd.

About my research
======
My research interests lie in Complex Analysis and Integrable systems. In particular, I use results from classical Nevanlinna theory to find meromorphic solutions of system of differential equations that are in general not integrable. In this direction, I have concluded all meromorphic solutions of a 3 dimensional Lotka-Volterra system. I also use the method to charactize the meromorphic solutions of a spinning top system (Euler-Poisson equations).

I also investigate the Riemann surface of the inverse of a Koenig's function in Complex Dynamics.
